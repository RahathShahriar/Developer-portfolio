            <p>Lynx looks much like the stereotypical Ninja, clad in gilded black Armor and a mask which leaves only his eyes and the upper portion of his nose exposed. He bears the Demons' symbol on his shoulder, headband, and belt.</p>

                <p>
                    Lynx is an arrogant character, believing very strongly in his abilities and viewing those who serve him as insignificant.

            <p>
                Lynx uses three-bladed claws as his primary weapon. He is the first enemy encountered to use ranged weapons (Shurikens and Throwing Daggers)
